            </div>
            <p>We've just read about what inertia is. Inertia is the property of an object to stay in its state of rest.  </p>
            <p>A related concept is that of moment of inertia or rotational inertia. </p>
            <p>Rotational inertia of an object tells you how difficult it is to change the 
                rotational velocity (how fast an object rotates) of an object around a rotational axis. </p>
                <p>For example, you know that the earth rotates about its axis. </p>

<p>The rotational inertia of an object not only depends on its mass, but it also depends on the distribution of the mass relative to its axis of rotation.</p>
<p>A great example of rotational inertia in use is the spinning of ice skaters. </p>
<p>Ice skaters can significantly increase their speed of spinning/rotation, by pulling their hands towards their body. </p>

<p>When the mass of an object is away from its axis of rotation it becomes increasingly difficult to change the rotational velocity of the object.</p>
<p>If however the mass of the object shifts towards the axis of rotation, the moment of inertia of the object decreases. </p>
<p>The angle at which the rotation is taking place is called angular momentum and is usually <b>conserved</b>, i.e it doesn't change unless an external force acts on it. </p>
<p>The angular momentum remains the same, while the moment of inertia decreases, which means the angular velocity (speed of rotation) increases! </p>
