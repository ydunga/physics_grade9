          <p>We can convert one kind of energy into another and use it for our purposes. </p>
          <p>In the previous section you read that windmills and water dams can harness the potential and kinetic energy of wind and water and convert it into electrical energy used by our appliances. </p>
          <p>Devices that convert a form of energy into electricity are <b>generators. </b>You will read more about electric current and generators in higher classes. </p>

          </div>
          <p>Similar to the law of conservation of momentum, the law of conservation of energy states that while energy can be transformed from one form to another, the total energy of the objects involved remainsthe same. Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed, it can simply be transferred. </p>

          </div>
          <p> Think about how much energy is needed to power large cities and countries. </p>
          <p>To measure such large quantities of energy, we don't use Joule. Instead we use a bigger unit of energy called kilowatt hour(kW h). </p>
          <p>Watt is the unit with which we measure power and power is defined as the amount of work done per unit of time. </p>
          <p>1 watt = 1 Joule/ second
          <br> 
            1 kilowatt = 1000 J s <sup>-1</sup>
              <br>
            1kW h = 1kW X 3600s
            <br>
            = 1000W X 3600s
            <br>
            = 3600000J
            <br>
            = 3.6 X 10<sup>6</sup> J
