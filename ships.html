            </div>
            <p>Ships are extremely large and heavy vessels made of steel. They carry thousands of kgs worth of cargo on them and yet they do not sink in the sea! </p>
            <p>We know that the density of steel is higher than that of water, so why is it that the ship made of steel can float on water?</p>

        <div class = "bottompane">
            <p>The reasons for this are twofold.</p>
            <p>First, ships are actually hollow from the inside. They have an internal structure and can store things inside or on top, but for the most part ships are hollow structures. </p>
            <p>This means air occupies the hollow space in the ship and we know that air is less dense than water.</p>
            <p>The second related reason is buoyancy and the <b>Archimedes principle</b>!</p>
            <p>According to the archimedes principle , when an object is in or resting on water it experiences an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the water it would push or displace from the water body. </p>
            <p>Because of the ship's hollow structure, it displaces a certain amount of water and experiences net positive buoyancy which lets it float on water. </p>
