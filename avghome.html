            <p>In order to supply electrical energy to millions of homes in a country, a grid of electricity distribution is needed. </p>
            <p>The process of electricity generation usually begins in a power station. </p>
            <object data = "coalplantsmoke.gif" type = "image/svg+xml" width = "500" height = "500"></object>
       <p>Most power stations in the world burn fossil fuels like coal and natural gas to power their generators which convert mechanical power to electric power. </p>
       <object data = "turbogenerator.svg" type = "image/svg+xml" width = "500" height = "500"></object>
    <p>The power plant is usually connected to the electric grid. </p>
    <p>The grid itself consists of the power plant and the further transmission channels. </p>
    <p>The interconnected lines which transport electricity from the plant to the end customer are known as the transmission network. </p>
    <p>You must have seen the tall electric poles with many long wires connected to them. These poles are part of the transmission network.</p>

    <p>From the transmission network the electricity reaches your homes and streetlights and allow you to do things like switching on the light below.</p>
    <p>Click on the button to turn on the light!</p>
