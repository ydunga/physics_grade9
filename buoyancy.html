          <p>Have you ever noticed that when you drop an object, like a plastic bottle in a container full of water, the object floats on the water. </p>
          <p>Why is it that the object in water does not fall to the ground? Is the downward pull of the earth's gravitation being countered by another force?</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "middlepane">
          <div class ="subheading">
            <div class = "subback">Buoyancy</div>
          </div>
          <p>Water or any liquid for that matter, exerts an upward force on the plastic bottle. The force exerted by the water on the bottle is greater than its weight (W = m*g) and hence the plastic bottle floats on water.  </p>
          <p>This upward thrust exerted by water is known as <b> buoyancy</b>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "bottompane">
          <p>Whether an object sinks or floats, when dropped in water depends on its <b>density</b>.</p>
          <p>The density of a substance is defined as the mass per unit of volume. </p>
          <p>If an object sinks in water, this means it has greater density than water. Whereas if it floats, that means the object's density is lower than that of water. </p>
          <p>We can define the density of an object relative to water. This is known as <b>relative density.</b></p>
